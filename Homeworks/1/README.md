1. Create a program that determines the MPH someone is traveling on a bike. You will need to gather the distance (in miles) and the time(in minutes) and then display the MPH (Miles Per Hour) they are traveling.
example: If Bob has traveled 8.5 miles and it took him 30 minutes he would traveling 17 Miles per Hour.

2. Create a program (file) that allows a user to enter 2 numbers. Print out (to the screen) both numbers 6 times.
