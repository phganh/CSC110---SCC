Create a program that determines the cost of sending out coffee.

The Konditorei coffee shop sells coffee at $10.50 a pound for their Jonestown Brew, and $16.95 for their Plymouth Jolt. The cost of shipping is $0.93 per pound. In addition there is a handling cost of $2.50 per order. When the user places an order they will choose one of the two types of coffee, they will enter the number of lbs they are ordering. They will enter in their City and State. They will pick the shipping method: Overnight, 2-Day or Standard. They will enter in their payment option: PayPal, Credit Card, Check.

You will display the Coffee type and # of lbs they have ordered, the Coffee Cost, the Shipping & Handling Costs, the subtotal (Coffee + Shipping & Handling), the City and State it is being shipped to, the Delivery Method, the Payment type, The Tax and the Total. Format in currency where appropriate.

Tax is 9% for Washington, California and Texas, 0% for Oregon or Florida, all other are 7%. Tax is applied to the Coffee and the Shipping & Handling. The delivery methods are Overnight ($20.00), 2-Day ($13.00), Standard ($0.00). For Payment options the Paypal has a 3% increase on the subtotal, Credit Cards has a 5% increase on the subtotal, Checks have a 2% discount on the subtotal.

You are required to use functions. One function to determine the Shipping & Handling costs, another function to determine the Tax and another to determine the Coffee Cost.

Addition: Use a Try Except block to catch the program from blowing up.
