Checking Account Program

Working with your new homework partner create a project to compute a checking account balance. 

Prompt the user to enter the amount of the transaction. 
Prompt the user to indicate the type of transaction: deposit, withdrawal, or service charge. 
Display the new balance formatted.
The user can end the program by typing in “end” in the amount of transaction entry field.
Display the summary at that point. Which includes the Account balance, the total number of Deposits and the dollar amount of Deposits, the total number of Withdrawals, the dollar amount of the Withdrawals, the total number of the Service Charges,  and the dollar amount of the Service Charges. All formatted with US currency where appropriate.
 
Calculate the balance by adding deposits and subtracting service charges and withdrawals.  

Display a message if the amount of the transaction is a negative number.  Do not deduct (or add) the negative amount from the balance.

If there is not enough money to cover a Withdrawal, display an error message.Do not subtract the Withdrawal, but deduct a service charge of $10 (even if that brings you below $0.00).
