Working with your homework partner create a program that determines the cost of 3 items shipped with tax. The user will enter the following information for 3 different items:

Description
Price
Quantity
Weight per item
You will capture the 4 pieces of information for each of the 3 items. You will then let the user know what they bought, how much is the SubTotal, Shipping costs, the Tax and the Total.

You will display the following type of message:
You have purchased: Shovel Planter Broom
The subtotal is $127.00
The Shipping and Handling costs are $13.00
The Tax is $11.90 
The Total is $151.90.
Shipping and Tax: Shipping is 25 cents a pound with a Handling charge of $5 per order. Tax is 8.5%.

Test Data:
You need to develop some test data and put it into your comments in the program

Here is an example-
# Shovel $25.00 1 each 6lbs
# Planter $45.00 2 each 11lbs
# Broom $12.00 1 each 4lbs
# Subtotal is $127.00, Shipping & Handling is $13.00, Tax is $11.90 and the Total is $151.90.
