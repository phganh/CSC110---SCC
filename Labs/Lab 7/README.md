Write a program that calculates the cost per square inch of a circular pizza, given its diameter and price.  
The formula for area is A = π * (r^2) 


Create two functions(besides the main function)—one to compute the area of the pizza, and one to compute cost per square inch. 
The main function calls the Area function, that function calls the Cost per Square Inch function, 
a value is returned to the Area function and that value is returned to the main function for printing.
