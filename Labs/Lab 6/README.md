Word count. A common utility on Unix/Linux systems is a small program called “wc”. 
This program counts the number of lines, words (strings of characters separated by blanks or new lines), and characters in a file (not including blank spaces between words). Write your own version of this program. The program should accept a file name as input and then print three numbers showing the count of lines, words, and characters(do not count blank spaces) in the file.
 You can use the [quotes.txt](https://github.com/phganh/CSC110---SCC/files/1351093/quotes.txt) as your test file.
