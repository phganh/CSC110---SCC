## Lab 8: Deep Cold

Create a graphics window program that will display the 5 side of a dice.

From the main() function you must call a dice() function to "build" the dice. To draw the dots you will then need to call a dot() function.

Call the dot() function 5 times from the dice() function rather than drawing 5 dots inside the dice() function.
