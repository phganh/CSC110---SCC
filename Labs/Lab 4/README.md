1) The body mass index (BMI) is calculated as a person’s weight (in pounds) times 703, divided by their height (in inches) squared. A BMI in the range 19-25, inclusive, is considered healthy. Write a program that calculates and prints a person’s BMI as well as telling them whether they are above, within, or below the healthy range.

2) Create the Congress Program as Python program: 
  A) A person is eligible to be a US senator if they are at least 30 years old and have been a US citizen for at least 9 years. 
  B) To be a US representative these numbers are 25 and 7, respectively. 
  C) They are not eligible for either if...?
Your program will accept a person's age and years of citizenship as inputs. Your outputs will be "You are eligible to be a Senator", "You are eligible to be a Representative", "You are not eligible to run for Congress".

Hints: If statements will be your main strategy. First solve to determine if they can be a senator. Then solve for them to be a representative. Then combine both. 

DO NOT USE "and" : If fltAge < 100 and fltAge > 25:c

DO NOT USE a range : If 25 < fltAge < 100:
