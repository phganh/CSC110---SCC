The body mass index (BMI) is calculated as a person’s weight (in pounds) times 703, divided by their height (in inches) squared. A BMI in the range 19-25, inclusive, is considered healthy. Write a program that calculates and prints a person’s BMI as well as telling them whether they are above, within, or below the healthy range.
