A) Numerologists claim to be able to determine a person's character traits based on the "numeric value" of a name.  The value of a name is determined by summing up the values of the letters of the name where 'a' is 1, 'b' = 2, â€¦,'z' = 26.  Upper- and lower-case letters are treated as equal.  For example, "Tindell" would have value 20+9+14+4+5+12+12 = 76. You can assume there will be NO PUNCTUATION in the entered name.

Write a program that prints the numeric value of a single name (first or last) entered by the user.

Hint: you can use ord() to help with the number.


B) Write a program that calculates the average word length in a sentence entered by the user. You can assume there will be NO PUNCTUATION in the entered sentence and you are not to count blank spaces.

Example: The fastest way to home is by car
this sentence has 8 words with 26 letters, therefore the average word length is 3.25
