## 7.2 Discussion: Function - Scholarship

Create a program that takes a student's grades and credits from up to 5 classes (as letter grades, A, B, C etc). It also collects the number of recommendation letters from the user. The program determines if the student is eligeble for a scholarship.

A = 4.0

B = 3.5

C = 3.0

D = 2.5

F = 0.0

To be eligible for the scholarship they have to have more than 20 credits, a GPA of 3.7 or above and 2 or more letters.

You will need to create 3 functions as laid out below.
