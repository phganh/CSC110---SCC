## 6.1 Discussion: Read a File

You are to create a program that opens this [dogs.txt](https://github.com/phganh/CSC110---SCC/files/1351072/dogs.txt), reads the file into the program, searches it for the highest ranking breed and displays that.

For extra fun work can you sort and display the breeds in order of their ranking? You can? Great, I can't wait to see it.

## 6.2 Discussion: Function - Lightning Distance

Write a program that determines the distance to a lightning strike based on the time elapsed between the flash and the sound of thunder. The speed of sound is approximately 1120 ft/sec and 1 mile is 5280 ft.

You need to use a function for this program. It needs to take a single argument and return a single value.
