## 4.3 Discussion: Boolean Operators And Or - Blackjack


Write some code that checks the input of cards for a blackjack game.

Convert the card value into an integer, but they may enter J, Q, K, or A
(which stand for Jack, Queen, King and Ace).

If they enter J, Q, or K then convert that into the integer 10.
If they enter A then convert that into the integer 11.
