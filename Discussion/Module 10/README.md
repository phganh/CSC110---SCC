## 10.1 Discussion: Lists and Master List


Create a program that has 4 lists.

One list has the title of 5 books. Another list has the price of the 5 books and another list has the quantity of the 5 books. 

Put all 3 lists into a Master List(the fourth list).

Using a loop print out the Title of each book and the value of the inventory (quantity * price)

Ex: The book "100 Years of Solitude" has an inventory value of $568.78
